<h1>Annotations for the <a href="https://panorama.grand-challenge.org">PANORAMA challenge</a>: Public Training and Development Dataset</h1>

<h2>Imaging Dataset </h2>

<h2>Reference Standard</h2>
<p>The training and development set of the <a href="https://panorama.grand-challenge.org">PANORAMA challenge</a> includes patients with the following reference standard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Histopathology confirmation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) via resection specimen, biopsy, or cytology analysis</li>
  <li>Histopathology confirmation of non-PDAC lesion via resection specimen, biopsy, or cytology analysis</li>
  <li>CT confirmation of PDAC without follow-up</li>
  <li>CT confirmation of non-PDAC lesion without follow-up</li>
  <li>CT confirmation of healthy/unremarkable pancreas without follow-up</li>
</ul>
<p>The reference standard used for each individual can be found in clinical_information.csv</p>

<h2>Annotations</h2>
<p>For positive cases (PDAC) in the public data set, manual tumor segmentations were generated by one of 2 trained investigators supervised by an expert radiologist with over 20 years of pancreatic cancer experience. There are 676 PDAC cases in the data set, of which 482 have manual annotations. For the remaining 194 cases, tumor segmentations were automatically generated using an updated algorithm with the same model described and validated by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35053538/">Alves, et al (2021)</a>. </p>
<p>For all cases in the public training and development data sets, segmentations of the pancreas parenchyma, pancreatic duct, veins, arteries, and common bile duct are provided. These segmentations were automatically generated by the algorithm described and validated by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35053538/">Alves, et al (2021)</a>.</p>
